ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Aneta Sobczyk,

I live in Krakow, Poland, and work in IT since 2013. 

I've started as a SAP Support Analyst but was always interested in the technical side of the applications. Currently I work as MES Expert (industrial automation) and I use SQL to create reports.
During my working time I also automated several solutions using VBA.

ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in analysis os the business processes and their automation.

ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning SQL, Python and Tableau.

ğŸ“« You can reach me under my e-mail address: aneta.sobczyk01@gmail.com
